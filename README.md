# Architectural Style Classification for Mobile Applications

This project aims at developing an architectural style classification model eligible for the use on mobile devices and is conducted as part of the course Applied Deep Learning at TU Wien. The approach combines the MobileNets architecture with a channel-spatial attention mechanism.

A detailed project description can be found in the PDF document "Assignment_1" that contains a proposal for the project.
